Your images go in this directory.

To attach or link images directly from this subdirectory, you may use:

- HTML
```<img src="" src="https://github.com/TimelessFez/repository-name/blob/main/images/your-image-filename.png" width="69" height="420">>```
The width and height attributes are optional. If only one of these attributes is used, the image will automatically adjust by scaling up or down whilst maintaining its original aspect ratio.

For example, if an image is ``1920x1080``px (16:9 ratio) in size, using only the ``width`` attribute with a value of ``400``px will automatically scale down the ``height`` value to ``225``px. 

We can verify that it maintains the same aspect ratio of 16:9 by simplifying the ratio 400:225 *(values taken from the resized image of 400x225 px)*.

By dividing both numbers with their greatest common factor (GCF) of 25, we get the following:

```
400 (รท 25) | 225 (รท 25)
 16        |   9
         16:9
```
